Find peaks - Input a spreadsheet with spectrum measurements, each measurement in a different sheet. Outputs a spreadsheet with the wavelength of the top two peaks in the measurements.

Polariton fitting code - Input spreadsheets with calculated values of k and E. One for each, upper and lower. Outputs a graph of the fitting and outputs the fitting parameters.
