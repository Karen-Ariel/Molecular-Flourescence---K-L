# Molecular-Flourescence---K-L

# Section 1 - Constant Length Changing Concentration

input spreadsheet with spectra so it integrates
outputs spreadsheet with integration values

linear fit concentration with integration and does a poly fit - order 1 for linear order 3 for poly
outputs grpah


# Section 2 - Constant Concentration Differing Length

code that    

# Section 3 - Polariton
Find peaks - Input a spreadsheet with spectrum measurements, each measurement in a different sheet. Outputs a spreadsheet with the wavelength of the top two peaks in the measurements.

Polariton fitting code - Input spreadsheets with calculated values of k and E. One for each, upper and lower. Outputs a graph of the fitting and outputs the fitting parameters.
