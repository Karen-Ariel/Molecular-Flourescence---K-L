# Molecular-Flourescence---K-L

# Section 1 - Constant Length Changing Concentration

Integral - Input spreadsheet with spectra, outputs a new spreadsheet that integrates each sheet from a specific value. 

linear Fit -  Takes the spreadsheet output from the integral code and creates a graph with a polynomial fitting - order 1 for a linear fit, order 3 for the poly fit used in the paper. 


# Section 2 - Constant Concentration Differing Length
photo code - Takes the photograph of the fluorescent sample as input, outputs light intensity as a function of distance x at a specific height in the photograph. 

Linear fit and poly fit - same as in previous section, makes a fitting and graph of order one and order 3.

# Section 3 - Polariton
Find peaks - Input a spreadsheet with spectrum measurements, each measurement in a different sheet. Outputs a spreadsheet with the wavelength of the top two peaks in the measurements.

Polariton fitting code - Input spreadsheets with calculated values of k and E. One for each, upper and lower. Outputs a graph of the fitting and outputs the fitting parameters.
